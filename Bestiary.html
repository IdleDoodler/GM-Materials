<b>Disease:</b> Anyone hit contracts a horrible rotting disease (save versus poison with a +4 bonus). Permanently lose 2 points of CHA per month (death if CHA reaches 0); magical healing is ineffective; natural healing is ten times slower. The disease can only be removed by magic .<br>
<b>Burrowing worms:</b> A worm leaps from the spawn’s skull at a character in melee. This requires an attack roll. If the worm hits, it starts to burrow into the victim’s flesh. In 1d4 rounds, it reaches the brain, killing the victim, who becomes a spawn of the worm in 6 turns.<br>
<b>Killing worms:</b> The first round after a worm hits, it can be killed by contact with steel, holy water, or a blessed object. Subsequently, only magic (e.g. cure disease) will work.<br>

<b>Return from death:</b> If killed (0hp), regenerate and fight again in 2d6 rounds.<br>

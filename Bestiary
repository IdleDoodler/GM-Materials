* **Surprise:** Characters surprised by a basilisk meet its gaze.
* **Petrifying touch:** Anyone touched by a basilisk is turned to stone (save vs petrify).
* **Petrifying gaze:** Anyone meeting a basilisk’s gaze is turned to stone (save versus petrify). Unless averting eyes or using a mirror, characters in melee are affected each round.
* **Averting eyes:** –4 penalty to-hit; the basilisk gains a +2 bonus to attack.
* **Mirrors:** The reflection of a basilisk is harmless. Fighting by looking in a mirror incurs a –1 penalty to attack. If a basilisk sees its own reflection (2-in-6 chance), it must save or be petrified.

* **Cold aura:** The area around a brown mould is noticeably cooler than average.
* **Area:** Each 10 square feet (e.g. 2’ × 5’) covered in brown mould is treated as one “individual”. (A 10’ × 10’ area would consist of 10 individual moulds.)
* **Immunity:** Unharmed by all attacks but magical cold.
* **Heat drain:** Any creature within 5’ of the mould suffers 1d8 damage per round.
* **Multiplication:** Fire within 5’ causes the mould to grow rapidly. Burning torch: 2 × size, burning oil: 4 × size, fire ball: 8 × size. Multiplication takes one round.

* **Blend in with stone:** May be overlooked or mistaken for statues, due to their stony colouration.
* **Shriek:** If attacked or frightened, shriek to warn others. This may attract wandering monsters (20% chance per round).
* **Jump:** Very skittish. If attacked,usually flee by jumping up to 60’ then flying away. 50% chance of jumping at a random opponent, in which case treat the jump as an attack.
* **Spit:** Used defensively. 10’ range. Target treated as AC 9 [10]. The affected character is covered in stinking spittle: unable to act for 1 turn (save versus poison). Until the goo is washed off, others who come within 5’ must also save versus poison or be viole
* **Poison immunity:** Immune to yellow mould and most poisons, due to their habit of eating fungi.

* **Surprise:** On a 1–5, if mouther remains motionless with eyes and mouths closed. Appears like a mound of earth.
* **Attaching:** On a successful bite attack, the mouth locks onto the victim and inflicts 1 damage in subsequent rounds.
* **Detach:** If mouther or victim dies.
* **Slip:** 1-in-6 chance of victim falling to the ground. The mouther then immediately oozes on top of the victim and attacks with 6 more mouths.
* **Gibbering:** All within 60’ who hear the babbling of dozens of mouths must save versus spells or be maddened. Victims behave randomly as long as the gibbering continues; roll 1d8 each round. 1: move randomly, 2–5: no action, 6–7: attack nearest creature, 8: flee.

* **Burrowing:** Can burrow through solid stone at 10’ (3’) or soft earth at 60’ (20’).
* **Surprise:** Characters surprised by a hulker meet its gaze.
* **Confusing gaze:** Anyone meeting a hulker’s gaze is confused for 3d4 rounds (save versus spells). Unless averting eyes or using a mirror, characters in melee are affected each round.
* **Confusion:** Victims behave randomly; roll 1d8 each round. 1: move randomly, 2–5: no action, 6–7: attack nearest creature, 8: flee.
* **Averting eyes:** –4 penalty to hit; the hulker gains a +2 bonus to attack.
* **Mirrors:** The reflection of a hulker is harmless. Fighting by looking in a mirror incurs a –1 penalty to attack.

* **Size and locomotion:** A swarm may be composed of creepers (e.g. spiders, ants, centipedes) or flyers (e.g. bees, hornets). Some swarms are capable of both types of movement (e.g. beetles, locusts).

* **Immunity:** Only harmed by fire, extreme cold, sleep spells (affect the whole swarm), smoke (drives off), or other attacks as the referee wishes.
* **Swarm attack:** Automatically damages characters within swarm area: 2hp if wearing armour, 4hp without.
* **Warding off:** Characters inside the swarm who defend themselves by brandishinga weapon (or similar) suffer half damage from the swarm. A brandished torch damages the swarm.
* **Escaping:** On exiting the swarm, characters continue to suffer half damage until 3 rounds are spent swatting the attached insects.
* **Diving into water:** Suffer damage for one round, then attached insects drown.
* **Pursuit:** An angry (i.e. damaged) swarm will pursue characters until they are out of sight or inaccessible.

* **Undead:** Make no noise, until they attack. Immune to effects that affect living creatures (e.g. poison). Immune to mind-affecting or mind-reading spells (e.g. charm, hold, sleep).
* **Aura of fear:** All coming within 30’ must save versus spells or flee for 1 turn.
* **Disease:** Anyone hit contracts a horrible rotting disease (save versus poison with a +4 bonus). Permanently lose 2 points of CHA per month (death if CHA reaches 0); magical healing is ineffective; natural healing is ten times slower. The disease can only be removed
* **Burrowing worms:** A worm leaps from the spawn’s skull at a character in melee. This requires an attack roll. If the worm hits, it starts to burrow into the victim’s flesh. In 1d4 rounds, it reaches the brain, killing the victim, who becomes a spawn of the worm in 6 turns.
* **Killing worms:** The first round after a worm hits, it can be killed by contact with steel, holy water, or a blessed object. Subsequently, only magic (e.g. cure disease) will work.
* **Regeneration:** Regain 2hp per round. Severed limbs reattach.
* **Return from death:** If killed (0hp), regenerate and fight again in 2d6 rounds.
* **Fire, acid, holy water:** Cannot regenerate damage from these sources. The only way to permanently kill a spawn.

* **Aura of terror:** Creatures of under 3 HD who behold a tarrasque are paralysed with terror until it is out of sight. Creatures of more than 3 HD will instead flee in terror for 6 turns. Creatures of 7 HD or higher may save vs paralysis to resist.
* **Charge:** In first round of combat, when not in melee. Requires a clear run of at least 20 yards. Horns inflict double damage.
* **Severing:** A bite attack roll of 18 or higher indicates that one of the target’s extremities (determined randomly, e.g. 1–2: leg, 3–4: arm, 5–6: head) is severed.
* **Regeneration:** A damaged tarrasque gains 1hp at the start of each round.
* **Return from death:** If killed (0hp), will regenerate, reforming completely from even only a tiny piece.
* **Killing permanently:** Only possible by reducing to 0hp then using a wish.
* **Energy reflection:** Immune to energy rays, cones, and bolts (lighting, cold, magic missiles, etc.). 1-in-6 chance of the attack being reflected back at its origin.
* **Fire immunity:** Unharmed by fire.
* **Mundane damage immunity:** Can only be harmed by magical attacks.
* **Carapace:** 10d10 diamonds (1,000gp value each) can be extracted from the carapace. It is also possible to craft magic shields from the plates.
* **Sleeping:** Sleep in lair for months or years, before emerging for 1–2 weeks of voracious feeding.
* **Unique:** It is rumoured that there may only be a single tarrasque.
